## Rally Workflow

This is an extension of [Flowdock's Jenkins Plugin](https://github.com/flowdock/jenkins-flowdock-plugin). This plugin provides additional configuration options for sending private messages to users responsible for breaking certain builds.

The intention of this plugin is to increase developer awareness around how their code has effected builds.

*italic* Note: tTis project is specific to Rally Software and our Jenkin's workflow. It is not intended to be a general purpose extension. Hence it is not a fork.
